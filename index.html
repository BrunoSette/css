    <h1>Baby, I Love Your Way</h1>
    <p>Ooh baby, I love your way, everyday yeah, yeah</p>
    <p>Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday</p>
    <p>Shadows grow so long before my eyes</p>
    <p>And they're moving across the page</p>
    <p>Suddenly the day turns into night</p>
    <p>Far away, from the city</p>
    <p>But don't, oh no, hesitate</p>
    <p>'Cause your love just won't wait (Hey yeah, yeah)</p>
    <p>Ooh baby, I love your way, everyday</p>
    <p>yeah I wanna be with you night and day</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The moon appears to shine and light the skies</p>
    <p>
      With the help of some fireflies I wonder how they have the power to shine,
      shine, shine
    </p>
    <p>I can see them under the pine</p>
    <p>But don't, oh no no, hesitate, la di dah</p>
    <p>'Cause your love, just won't wait (Hey yeah, yeah)</p>
    <p>Ooh baby, I love your way, everyday</p>
    <p>I wanna tell you I love your way, everyday (Hey yeah)</p>
    <p>I wanna be with you night and day (Whoa baby, oh baby please)</p>
    <p>Everyday yeah, yeah I would love, I would love ya</p>
    <p>I love your way (Oh baby please)</p>
    <p>I can see the sunset in your eyes</p>
    <p>Brown and grey and blue besides</p>
    <p>Clouds are stalking islands in the sun</p>
    <p>I wish I could buy one out of season</p>
    <p>But don't, oh no no, hesitate, la di dah</p>
    <p>'Cause your love just won't wait, just won't wait</p>
    <p>Ooh baby, I love your way (Every, everyday)</p>
    <p>
      I wanna tell you I love your way (I wanna tell you how I love your little
      ways)
    </p>
    <p>I wanna be with you night and day (Everyday, in every way)</p>
    <p>
      Ooh baby, I love your way (Ooh baby how I love your little ways, yeah)
    </p>
    <p>I wanna tell you I love your way (I wanna tell you how I)</p>
    <p>(I wanna tell you how I love your little ways)</p>
    <p>I wanna be with you night and day</p>
